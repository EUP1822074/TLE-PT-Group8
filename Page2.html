<font size=5>On February 7, a published study showed that the new UK variant of coronavirus is rapidly moving through the US. This strain is thought to be more contagious and cases are doubling every ninth day. The spread of the new strain is causing more vaccine panic as officials work to get the majority of people vaccinated. The 'UK variant' — B.1.1.7 It has a large number of mutations, many of which involve the virus's spike protein, which helps the virus invade human cells. It has spread rapidly throughout the UK since it emerged, and to at least 70 other countries, including Australia. U.K. government scientific advisers say the COVID-19 variant now predominant in the country may be up to 70% more deadly than previous variants, underscoring concerns about how mutations may change the characteristics of the disease. The cough was the most common symptom in those infected with the new variant. The other common symptoms were: fatigue/weakness, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, and fever.</p></font><br>
