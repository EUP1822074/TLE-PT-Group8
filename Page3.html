<font size=5>Our drawing is a bird that is flying with a flower carrying in its mouth which represents hope. Hope, a feeling of expectation and desire for a certaing thing to happen. You can feel hope when you are up to something or expecting something. Hope is everywhere, just trust yourself and go on. It not only can help make a tough present situation more bearable but also can eventually improve our lives because envisioning a better future motivates you to take the steps to make it happen.</p></font><br>
